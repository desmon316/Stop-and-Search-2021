# Stop-and-Search-2021

Analysis of the Stop and Search data for Jan to Dec 2021 was carried out to evaluate the parameters involved in stop and searches. The data was collected from https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/?org=db7940dd-ee1a-4a68-b874-c34151e16e82.

The data was too large to view the data using R Programming. Hence the data was reduced to the necessary observations using SQL and then the data was edited using R Programming. An additional column of age group was added to the data to identify the age group of individuals who are stopped and searched. The link for the programming data can be found: https://github.com/desmon316/Stop-and-Search-2021

While conducting the Analysis it was found out that people of European Origin were stopped the highest, followed closely by people of African/ Carribean Origin. This data itself would negate the common claims that people of dark skin colour are stopped the most. But, when we check the population of London, the contrast can be seen. The People of African,Carribean and Mixed origin (involving the African lineage) form at best 17% of the total population in London. But the ratio of Stops to the Population is about 2.5 times. This shows that people of African lineage are stopped more frequently than others. This can be due to genuine reasons or stereotyping of the skin colour. There may be some reasons but additional data may be needed to be analyzed to identify if there is stereotyping of people.

It was also observed that the stops are more prevelant on subjects who are younger  and the frequency of stops are more post afternoon to midnight. The stops are more frequent during the winter months. Most stops were conducted on suspicion of the subject carrying drugs with them, but in the highest cases there was nothing found or some other substances would have been found on them. More results can be found from using the R code.

While most of the Stop and Searches have resulted in the police not finding anything on the subject, questions can be raised on the validity of the operation. The police have to be trained to better identify threats and conduct the operations more diligently without any bias, if present.
